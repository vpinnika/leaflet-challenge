# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Visualize Global Earthquake Data
In this project, I have visualized earthquakes occurring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes all earthquake data for the Past 7 Days. I have also included an additional layer of tectonic plates to understand the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.

## Web application is deployed at the following link:

https://vpinnika.github.io/leaflet-challenge/.

## Technology stack used in developing this web application is as follows:
leaflet.js
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript
GeoJSON

## Data Sources used :
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
